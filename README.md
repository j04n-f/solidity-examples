# Solidity Patterns

## Contracts

### State Machine

The State Machine Pattern enables the Contracts to act as a state machine, which means that they have certain stages in which they behave differently or in which different functions can be called. A function call often ends a stage and transitions the contract into the next stage.

### Pull over Push

The Pull over Push Pattern shifts the risk associated with transferring ether to the User. Sending ether to another address in Ethereum involves a call to the receiving entity. There are several reasons why this external call could fail. If the receiving address is a contract, it could have a fallback function implemented that simply throws an exception, once it gets called. Another reason for failure is running out of gas. This can happen in cases where a lot of external calls have to be made within one single function call, for example when sending the profits of a bet to multiple winners.

### Checks-Effects-Interactions

The Checks-Effects-Interactions Pattern ensures that all code paths through a contract complete all required checks of the supplied parameters before modifying the contractâ€™s state (Checks); only then it makes any changes to the state (Effects); it may make calls to functions in other contracts after all planned state changes have been written to storage (Interactions). This is a common foolproof way to prevent reentrancy attacks, where an externally called malicious contract can double-spend an allowance, double-withdraw a balance, among other things, by using logic that calls back into the original contract before it has finalized its transaction.

### Mutex

The Mutex Pattern uses a mutex variable to protect critical parts of Contract code from repeated execution through external calls. The mutex variable is a variable used in a condition that must validate as true to execute subsequent smart contract code. Otherwise, the code protected by the mutex variable is not executed. After the execution of the protected smart contract code, the mutex is unlocked to allow for the next execution of the protected code

### Factory

The Factory Pattern automates the creation and management of new Contracts in a reliable and transparent manner. 

### Proxy

The Proxy Pattern allows upgrading a Contract Implementation logic, while making it accessible via a static address. The Proxy Contract stores the Implementation address into a pseudorandom slot address to avoid accidentally overwriting the value and expose the required functions to change the address. The Proxy forwards the calls to the Implementation Contract throught the `delegatecall(...)`. The Implementation Contract code is executed using the Proxy storage.
