# Solidity Patterns

## Contracts

### Withdraw

**Pull over Push**

Shift the risk associated with transferring ether to the User. Sending ether to another address in Ethereum involves a call to the receiving entity. There are several reasons why this external call could fail. If the receiving address is a contract, it could have a fallback function implemented that simply throws an exception, once it gets called. Another reason for failure is running out of gas. This can happen in cases where a lot of external calls have to be made within one single function call, for example when sending the profits of a bet to multiple winners.

**Checks-Effects-Interactions**

The Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern ensures that all code paths through a contract complete all required checks of the supplied parameters before modifying the contract’s state (Checks); only then it makes any changes to the state (Effects); it may make calls to functions in other contracts after all planned state changes have been written to storage (Interactions). This is a common foolproof way to prevent reentrancy attacks, where an externally called malicious contract can double-spend an allowance, double-withdraw a balance, among other things, by using logic that calls back into the original contract before it has finalized its transaction.

**Mutx**

A mutex variable protects critical parts of smart contract code from repeated execution through external calls. The mutex variable is a variable used in a condition that must validate as true to execute subsequent smart contract code. Otherwise, the code protected by the mutex variable is not executed. After the execution of the protected smart contract code, the mutex is unlocked to allow for the next execution of the protected code

### Factory

The Factory Pattern automates the deployment of Smart Contracts in a reliable and transparent manner.
