// only then it makes any changes to the state (Effects); it may make calls to functions in other
// contracts after all planned state changes have been written to storage (Interactions).
// This is a common foolproof way to prevent reentrancy attacks, where an externally called malicious
// contract can double-spend an allowance, double-withdraw a balance, among other things, by using
// logic that calls back into the original contract before it has finalized its transaction.
